```{r}
rest_inspec_american =
  rest_inspec %>%
  filter(boro != "Missing") %>% 
  filter(str_detect(dba, "[Aa][Mm][Ee][Rr][Ii][Cc][Aa][Nn]")) %>%
  mutate(
    year = substr(as.character(inspection_date), 1,4), 
    boro = str_to_title(boro),
    score = as.numeric(score))
```

## Boxplot 

This plot shows the distribution of scores by year.

```{r}
rest_inspec_american %>% 
  plot_ly(y = ~score, color = ~year, type = "box",
          colors = "Set2")
```


```{r}
rest_inspec_line=
  rest_inspec_american %>% 
  group_by(year, boro) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_score = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

## Line plot

This plot shows the mean_score for each borough over time.

```{r}
line_ggplot = 
  rest_inspec_line %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_score, color = boro)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()

ggplotly(line_ggplot)
```

Mean scores are the highest ever for all boroughs except Brooklyn.

## Bar chart

This chart shows the number of American restaurants in each borough.

```{r}
rest_inspec_american %>% 
  count(boro) %>%
  mutate(boro = fct_reorder(boro, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~boro, y = ~n, color = ~boro, type = "bar")
```
